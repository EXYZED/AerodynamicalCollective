# Fundamentals of Aerodynamics
**The field of Aerodynamics is an underrated component within engineering.**

It governs the interaction between a fluid environment with a solid body. Although a solid body may contain other properties that may make it more efficient (i.e. it is lighter in mass), these properties will be overruled by the powerful characteristic of Aerodynamics.

**Who am I?**  

I am a reticent apprentice aerodynamicist for 'X' Formula One Racing team, I also drive untested Formula One cars at low speed in sims for 'X' to take results from and extrapolate and analyse.

I have a strong background in the engineering field and specialise in aerodynamics within my free time and within my job role. I've created this blog as an objective to raise awareness and to provide online resources.
