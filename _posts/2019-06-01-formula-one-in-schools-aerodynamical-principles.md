## Setting Context

In Formula One Aerodynamics - most aerodynamic devices focus on the efficient delivery of downforce for the vehicle to attack turns with speed and control. With downforce, drag co-exists as a consequence.

In F1inSchools, the turning aspect of racing no longer exists. Cars will travel down a straight track at high speeds. Alternatively, this is known as a rocket-powered drag race. Many of these aerodynamical devices in Formula One cars are not required and may slow your vehicle down.

Although there are many other principles that allow a car to travel fast and first, this article will **mainly** focus on the __aerodynamical__ aspects of F1inSchools racing and may briefly reference other properties.
