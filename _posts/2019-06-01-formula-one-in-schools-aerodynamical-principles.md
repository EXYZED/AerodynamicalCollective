## Setting Context

In Formula One Aerodynamics - most aerodynamic devices focus on the efficient delivery of downforce for the vehicle to attack turns with speed and control. With downforce, drag co-exists as a consequence.

In F1inSchools, the turning aspect of racing no longer exists. Cars will travel down a straight track at high speeds. Alternatively, this is known as a rocket-powered drag race. Many of these aerodynamical devices in Formula One cars are not required and may slow your vehicle down.

Although there are many other principles that allow a car to travel fast and first, this article will **mainly** focus on the __aerodynamical__ aspects of F1inSchools racing and may briefly reference other properties.

## The functionality of the Front Wing Apparatus.

The design of the front wing plays a critical role in distributing weight, drag and lift components and forces of the vehicle. In many F1inSchools vehicle designs - the center of mass is usually established at the rear-center. Acknowledge that your front wing should be able to counteract this uneven weight by providing a turning moment and aerodynamical downforce component in the opposite turning moment created by the center of mass.

Creating turning moments, in general, will produce overall downforce on the vehicle. The vehicle design should account for creating lift as close as possible towards the center of mass to counteract this effect.

## Tire wake

Tire wake occurs when the moving air (also referenced as the freestream flow) collides with the opposing direction created by rotation.

In vehicle aerodynamics, tire wake is a detrimental source of drag. Tire wake causes flow stagnation and separation to occur moderately early - these early occurrences will result in extended wake turbulence. A common way of decreasing this wake turbulence is to reduce the contact between freestream flow and the surface area of the wheel, although many regulations prohibit that from being done - there are artificial means that reduce air and wheel contact, for example:

Creating an aerodynamic device that forces air to move in a different direction away from a solid object will decrease the rate of which air particles collide with the wheel and therefore will better maintain the momentum of motion for both air and solid - such aerodynamic device needs to account for the attack angle which contributes to creating a variant amount of downforce and drag:
* An inappropriate high angle of attack will not be efficient as most of the freestream kinetic energy will be transferred through the collision of the device itself. In addition to this, drag will be created behind this device and is counter-intuitive towards the problem.
* An inappropriate low angle of attack will be redundant towards the cause of reducing tire wake.
* A suitable angle of attack would be limited to the technical constraints of the competition - to cover as much as the wheel's contact surface area as possible without violating the regulations.
