## What is CFD?
Computational Fluid Dynamics is a form of digital aerodynamical analysis.

CFD uses heavy numerical analysis and data structures and processing to analyse. Computers are used to perform the complex calculations required to allow the fluid to be simulated in a free-stream environment as well as the interactions between the fluids with surfaces, and therefore demand high performance supercomputers to achieve better solutions.

## Components of CFD
There are pre-requisites for allowing CFD analysis to occur, conditions and parameters have to be pre-determined to function properly.

Generally, it is standard that these parameters are defined:

### Geometry.
The geometry and physical bounds of a problem can be defined using CAD (Computer Aided Design) software

The volume occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non-uniform, structured or unstructured, consisting of a combination of hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal or polyhedral elements.
The physical modeling is defined – for example, the equations of fluid motion + enthalpy + radiation + species conservation
Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at all bounding surfaces of the fluid domain. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.
