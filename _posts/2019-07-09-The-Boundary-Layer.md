# Boundary Layer  

The boundary layer is a relatively thin layer of viscous fluid relatively close and immediate to the solid surface of a wall in contact with the moving stream. The effects of viscosity are significant in the boundary layer.

## Laminar Boundary Layer Flow

The laminar boundary layer is characterised as very smooth flow, absent of swirls or "eddies" that are found in turbulent flow. The Laminar flow creates less skin friction drag but more volatile to instability.

Boundary layer flow over a bounding surface starts as a smooth laminar flow - as the flow continues aft from the leading edge to the trailing edge the laminar boundary layer increases in thickness.

## Turbulent Boundary Layer Flow

At a variant distance behind from the leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions into a turbulent flow.

In terms of drag, it is favorable to have this transition as far as possible from the aerodynamic object, or to have a larger and extended amount of surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer.

Low energy laminar flow is likely to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.

## Definitions

#### Velocity Boundary Layer Thickness
The thickness of the boundary layer is ordinarily defined as the distance from the aerodynamic body to the point at which viscous flow velocity is 99% of the free stream velocity.


#### Displacement thickness
