## What is lift?
> Lift is a force generated by a solid body moving through a fluid.
Note that air itself, is classified as a fluid.

**Lift** __directly opposes__ the **weight** of a body. In scope of a airplane - it opposes the weight of an airplane and allows the airplane to maintain in air. In a airplane, lift is generated by all the parts, but most of the lift on a airplane is generated by the wings.

>Lift is a mechanical aerodynamic force produced by the motion of the airplane through the air. Because lift is a force, it is a vector quantity, having both a magnitude and a direction associated with it. Lift acts through the center of pressure of the object and is directed perpendicular to the flow direction. There are several factors which affect the magnitude of lift.

## What causes lift?

## Applications in Flight

## Vector components of lift

## Incorrect Lift Theories

 * "Equal Transit / Longer Path Theory"
 * "Skipping Stone Theory"
 * "Venturi Theory"

## Navier-Stokes Equations

Navier-Stokes equations, accounting for many parameters such as
* Velocity
* Pressure
* Temperature
* Density
