## What is lift?
![DifficultyIndicator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Beginner-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)
> Lift is a force generated by a solid body moving through a fluid.
Note that air itself, is classified as a fluid.

**Lift** __directly opposes__ the **weight** of a body. In scope of a airplane - it opposes the weight of an airplane and allows the airplane to maintain in air. In a airplane, lift is generated by all the parts, but most of the lift on a airplane is generated by the wings.

>Lift is a mechanical aerodynamic force produced by the motion of the airplane through the air. Because lift is a force, it is a vector quantity, having both a magnitude and a direction associated with it. Lift acts through the center of pressure of the object and is directed perpendicular to the flow direction. There are several factors which affect the magnitude of lift. Glenn Research Center.

## Forces acting on a aircraft
There are 4 Fundamental forces acting on a flying body
 * **Lift** - Acting upwards in a vertical direction caused by net differences in air pressure.
 * **Weight** - Acting vertically downwards due to gravity.
 * **Thrust** - Acting forward parallel to the direction of flight due to artificial propulsion.
 * **Drag** - Acting in reverse to the direction of flight due to aerodynamical effects.

## Aerodynamic Forces acting on a aircraft
It is better to think of __lift__ and __drag__ as **components** of the aerodynamic force vector.

#### Gravitational
+ The Gravitational force is the body's weight, including all of it's contents (i.e. fuel, passengers and cargo).
 + Denoted as `$\textbf{W}$` $$\textbf{W}$$

In symmetrical <a href="https://aerodynamical-collective.com/2019/06/03/Disambiguation.html#Airfoil" target="_blank">airfoils</a> - where no <a href="https://aerodynamical-collective.com/2019/06/03/Disambiguation.html#Camber" target="_blank">camber</a> exists. It is important to acknowledge that the shape of the wing is no longer a critical determining factor in lift.
The shape of the wing is not the determining factor in lift.  


## Navier-Stokes Equations
![DifficultyIndicator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Advanced-red.svg?style=for-the-badge)  
Navier-Stokes equations, accounting for many parameters such as
* Velocity
* Pressure
* Temperature
* Density
respective to each other. But not limited.
