With donations as little as 2$, you can buy me a hot cup of cocoa.

## Mission Statement
Aerodynamical Collective was founded on the question:
"What is lift?"

Despite ground breaking technology and theories we still don't have a distinct physical definition on what lift is - we just know that all these theories interact with **air.**

We breathe it everyday, we need it to live, yet we really hate it when it comes to the complexity of the interaction between cars, aircraft, buildings, and human nature itself.

I created AC so that anyone else who has shares a similar curiousness in the field can help themselves to information.
