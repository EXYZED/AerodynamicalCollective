I am a reticent apprentice aerodynamicist for 'X' Formula One Racing team, I also drive untested Formula One cars at low speed in sims for 'X' to take results from and extrapolate and analyse.

I have a strong background in the engineering field and specialise in aerodynamics within my free time and within my job role. I've created this blog as an objective to raise awareness and to provide online resources.   

## Mission Statement
Aerodynamical Collective was founded on the question:
"What is lift?"

Despite ground breaking technology and theories we still don't have a distinct physical definition on what lift is - we just know that all these theories interact with **air.**

We breathe it everyday, we need it to live, yet we really hate it when it comes to the complexity of the interaction between cars, aircraft, buildings, and human nature itself.

Rather than understanding lift itself we can familiarise with the important concepts that surround it, because they are just as important.

I created AC so that anyone else who has shares a similar curiousness in the field can help themselves to information -

## How you can help:

### By Donation
With donations as little as 2$, you can buy me a hot cup of cocoa, they really help when I'm writing these articles. (All donations go towards the development of the site unless it's cocoa).

### By Critique
I made this website as a hobby- most of the things I write tend to be true based off my own research. Sometimes there may be misinterpretation when I read and I convey a completely different meaning. Or sometimes I get things glaringly wrong.

Anyone can re-write my work - suggest changes through GitHub by directly [editing any of the posts.](https://github.com/EXYZED/AerodynamicalCollective/tree/gh-pages/_posts) These edits will get checked.

Alternatively you can just mail me here:
