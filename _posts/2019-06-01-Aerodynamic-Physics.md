# Principles of Aerodynamical Physics

## What is lift?

![Beginner](/images/Difficulty/Beginner.svg)
{: .align-left}

General contextual knowledge.  

> Lift is a force generated by a solid body moving through a fluid.
Note that air itself, is classified as a fluid.

**Lift** __directly opposes__ the **weight** of a body. In scope of a airplane - it opposes the weight of an airplane and allows the airplane to maintain in air. In a airplane, lift is generated by all the parts, but most of the lift on a airplane is generated by the wings.

>Lift is a mechanical aerodynamic force produced by the motion of the airplane through the air. Because lift is a force, it is a vector quantity, having both a magnitude and a direction associated with it. Lift acts through the center of pressure of the object and is directed perpendicular to the flow direction. There are several factors which affect the magnitude of lift. - NASA Glenn Research Center.

## [Basic Forces acting on an aircraft](#BasicForces)  

![Beginner](/images/Difficulty/Beginner.svg){: .align-left}

General contextual knowledge applied.  

There are 4 fundamental forces acting on a flying body:
 * **Lift** - Acting upwards in a vertical direction caused by net differences in air pressure.
 * **Weight** - Acting vertically downwards due to gravity.
 * **Thrust** - Acting forward parallel to the direction of flight due to artificial propulsion.
 * **Drag** - Acting in reverse to the direction of flight due to aerodynamical effects.

When the **lift** force is greater than the **weight** force, then the flying body will ascend in altitude. Oppositely, when the **weight** force is greater than the **lift** force, the flying body will descend in altitude.

In a typical aircraft, lift is attached to thrust. The more thrust provided, the more lift is generated. This is due to the nature of how the wings of a aircraft work - Bernoulli's principle __basically__ dictates why this occurs, and is later explored in this post.

### Think
A:
* What will happen to the weight of the plane when during flight?
* How will this effect the lift / thrust of the plane?
* Why do airlines often partially fuel a plane?
* What information would the pilot require to determine how much fuel is needed?
B:
* How would you describe the atmosphere as you increase in altitude in terms of density?
* How would this affect the flight of a plane?
C:
* In terms of thrust and drag, why do planes have their maximum speed limit?
* What can be done to the shape of the plane to reduce drag?
* In terms of the angle of a plane and lift, what could you say about stalling?

## [Angle of Attack](#Angle of Attack)

In aerodynamics, the angle of attack specifies the angle between the chord of a wing and the direction of the relative wind in-front.

There is a relationship between the angle of attack and the lift a plane may produce.

Generally speaking:
* The higher the angle of attack, the higher the lift co-efficient (a variable mathematically used to determine the behaviour of lift). Provided that, at a certain limit also known as the critical angle of attack isn't breached.
* If the angle of attack passes the critical angle, the plane will no longer produce lift and will stall. This is also known as the "Stall Angle of Attack"

#### Critical Angle of Attack
The critical angle of attack is the angle of which produces the maximum lift-coefficient.

Above this critical angle of attack, the plane is said to be in a stall. The airspeed of which the aircraft stalls is dependant on the weight of a plane.

Commonly, for a pilot to exit stall conditions - they would attempt to reorientate the aircraft so that the angle of attack is minimal to the relative wind, which would be significantly inclined due to stalling.

### Think
A:
* What is the relationship between angle of attack and lift?
* How can the co-efficient of lift be used?
* The critical angle of attack is also known as?
B:
* What features can be implemented into a aircraft to prevent stalling?
* What is the relationship between stall speed and weight?
C:
* How does the atmosphere have an affect on the critical angle of attack.
* How does airspeed interact with stalling?

## Aerodynamic Forces acting on an aircraft

### Gravitational
The Gravitational force is the body's weight, including all of it's contents (i.e. fuel, passengers and cargo).   
**Denoted as** $$\textbf{W}$$
### Propulsive
The propulsive force referred to as the **thrust**, is the force acting on the body generated by artificial propulsion.  
**Denoted as** $$\textbf{T}$$
### Aerodynamic
**Note:** As you may have seen before, lift and drag are given as the [main forces](https://aerodynamical-collective.com/2019/06/01/Aerodynamic-Physics.html#BasicForces) acting on an aircraft. It is conventional to think of lift and drag as __components__ of the aerodynamic force vector.
{: .notice_warning}


The aerodynamic force is defined as the force generated by the fluid acting on the surface of the body.  
**Denoted as** $$\textbf{A}$$


## General Vector components of Aerodynamics

![Intermediate](/images/Difficulty/Intermediate.svg){: .align-left}

Pre-requisite to math-aided relationships.

In aerodynamics, the flow about a body is analysed using a co-ordinate system attached to the body. As a frame of reference, the velocity of the aircraft is   
$$V_a$$  
and the velocity of the wind ahead of the aircraft is  
$$V_w$$.  
In the body's frame of reference.
$$V_\infty = V_w - V_a$$  

Where $$V_{\infty}$$ is referred as the **freesteam velocity**, this component will also define the freestream direction, this has informally been referred as the relative wind velocity in engineering.

N.B. The 'fresstream' is the air far upstream of an aerodynamic object - subject to no deformation, deflection, compression or expansion. Conditions of the freestream are denoted as $$\infty$$.

We will create these assumptions:  
* The body is symmetric about the $$y=0$$ plane.
* The freesteam as has no sideslip (i.e. **no components in the y-direction**).
* The angle of attack $$\alpha$$ is the angle between the freestream and $$z=0$$ plane, note that the $$z=0$$ plane is arbitary.

But in this circumstance is parallel to a important geometric feature of the plane (such as the floor of the passenger compartment). And can be chosen to pass through the centre of gravity of the aircraft without additional weight (i.e. passengers and cargo).

For these critical factors, they will be geometrically defined as the following:
#### Drag
Will be the component of the aerodynamic force acting opposite the freestream direction.

#### Lift
Will be the component of the aerodynamic force acting **normal** to the freestream direction. In a three-dimentional flow the normal direction is not unique.

### Steady Level Flight
In steady level flight, an assumption is made that the aircraft will have constant velocity during cruise - as a result the acceleration is zero and hence all forces sum to zero. Therefore we may define that:  

$$L=W$$ - Lift is equal to weight forces.  
$$T=D$$ - Thrust is equal to Drag.  

For most mechanical systems:  
* **Weight is defined as a function of time**  
Because fuel is being consumed (and so the products of the process of combustion process are emitted), and so for this reason:  
* **Lift will also be treated as a function of time**  
And because the amount of drag is dependant on the lift:
* **Drag will also be treated as a function of time**  
And as drag has a relationship with thrust as defined before:  
* **Thrust will also be treated as a function of time**.

### Symmetrical Airfoils

Pre-requisite to background knowledge.  

In symmetrical [airfoils](https://aerodynamical-collective.com/2019/06/03/Disambiguation.html#Airfoil) where no camber exists. It is important to acknowledge that the shape of the wing is no longer a critical determining factor in lift.
The shape of the wing is not the determining factor in lift.
