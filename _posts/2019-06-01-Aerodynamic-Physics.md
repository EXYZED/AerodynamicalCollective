## What is lift?

> Lift is a force generated by a solid body moving through a fluid.
Note that air itself, is classified as a fluid.

**Lift** __directly opposes__ the **weight** of a body. In scope of a airplane - it opposes the weight of an airplane and allows the airplane to maintain in air. In a airplane, lift is generated by all the parts, but most of the lift on a airplane is generated by the wings.

>Lift is a mechanical aerodynamic force produced by the motion of the airplane through the air. Because lift is a force, it is a vector quantity, having both a magnitude and a direction associated with it. Lift acts through the center of pressure of the object and is directed perpendicular to the flow direction. There are several factors which affect the magnitude of lift. Glenn Research Center.

## [Basic Forces acting on an aircraft](#BasicForces)

There are 4 fundamental forces acting on a flying body:
 * **Lift** - Acting upwards in a vertical direction caused by net differences in air pressure.
 * **Weight** - Acting vertically downwards due to gravity.
 * **Thrust** - Acting forward parallel to the direction of flight due to artificial propulsion.
 * **Drag** - Acting in reverse to the direction of flight due to aerodynamical effects.

## Aerodynamic Forces acting on an aircraft

#### Gravitational
The Gravitational force is the body's weight, including all of it's contents (i.e. fuel, passengers and cargo).   
**Denoted as** $$\textbf{W}$$
#### Propulsive
The propulsive force referred to as the **thrust**, is the force acting on the body generated by artificial propulsion.  
**Denoted as** $$\textbf{T}$$
#### Aerodynamic
**Warning Notice:** As you may have seen before, lift and drag are given as the [main forces](https://aerodynamical-collective.com/2019/06/01/Aerodynamic-Physics.html#BasicForces) acting on an aircraft. It is conventional to think of lift and drag as __components__ of the Aerodynamic force vector.{: .notice_warning}


The aerodynamic force is defined as the force generated by the fluid acting on the surface of the body.  
**Denoted as** $$\textbf{A}$$

In symmetrical <a href="https://aerodynamical-collective.com/2019/06/03/Disambiguation.html#Airfoil" target="_blank">airfoils</a> - where no <a href="https://aerodynamical-collective.com/2019/06/03/Disambiguation.html#Camber" target="_blank">camber</a> exists. It is important to acknowledge that the shape of the wing is no longer a critical determining factor in lift.
The shape of the wing is not the determining factor in lift.  


## Navier-Stokes Equations
![DifficultyIndicator](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Advanced-red.svg?style=for-the-badge){: .align-left}   
Navier-Stokes equations, accounting for many parameters such as
* Velocity
* Pressure
* Temperature
* Density
respective to each other. But not limited.
