Vortex generation is a extremely complex field - I've therefore written this article in a format as if you were an engineer who wanted to implement this aerodynamical principle to your car.

You may be able to observe that in real Formula One cars, some of many aerodynamical devices are vortex generators. In basic aviation vortex generators are shaped as a small vane attached to a lifting surface of an airfoil to increase the aerodynamical efficiency of a vehicle.

It is important to first understand that properties and effects involved with vortices are highly volatile in magnitude. Correct usage of this principle will give beneficial effects to the efficiency of the vehicle. Whereas inappropriate use of vortex generation may cause more of a problem than a solution.

When explaining Vortex Generation, it's easier to understand it as these stages:

1. Interaction
2. Energy Transportation
3. Control & Effect

## Interaction
When the aerodynamic body's motion is relative to the air (opposite in direction), a vortex generator will create a vortex (net swirl) in which will partially increase the energy in the boundary layer in contact with the body (or airfoil) surface.

In this context, there is exists a boundary layer with different velocities depending on the distance away from the surface of the airfoil.

This interaction is achieved by using the energy from the high-speed air (where air which is a distance away from the plane of the airfoil, a source of energy) into relatively low-speed air nearer the surface of the airfoil.

## Energy Transportation
Vortex generators have an angular feature to their design to produce this effect.

A flat vortex generator with a slight angle against the flow will force air to move faster according to equal transit theory (Bernoulli's principle) - this would create a area of low pressure close to the generator to force high-speed air to transfer their energy into this boundary due to equilibrium effects, energy transfer is occurring and is re-energizing the low-speed air originally on the airfoil skin.

## Control & Effect
This effect creates a turbulent, high-energy boundary layer - which is less likely to separate than a laminar boundary layer.

This effect is desirable as wake (which is a factor in the magnitude of drag) is reduced, where drag is detrimental to the aerodynamical efficiency of a vehicle.

**It is a great misinterpretation to use this information to add excessive amounts of vortex generators to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of a vehicle.** Sometimes laminar flow is desired as it produces less air to skin friction than turbulent air flow - but is less resistant to flow separation, and therefore more volatile to instability.

Therefore usually, vortex generators are mainly used for *already* separated flow rather than on the *prevention* of separation of wings.

On an engineering perspective:
* Avoid using sharp changes in angles relative to the direction of the wind to preserve laminar flow.
* Place VG's where effectively used where flow is already separated and not laminar.
* Experiment with different types of shapes with Vortex Generators to see what effect they have.
