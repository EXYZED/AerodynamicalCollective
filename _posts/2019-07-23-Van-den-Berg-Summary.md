Context:


Explanation of different wing heights for the dual airfoils - interactions between the wheels.
Parameters explored:

- Ground effect
- Separation and Stagnation points.
- Oil flow analysis

D. Jacques contributions:
- Difference between PIV [Where results are taken from numerous methods] SRANS (Steady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) &  DES (Detached Eddy Simulation). DNS and RANS have been excluded from the simulation as the object is dynamic in nature.

## Application into F1 Aerodynamics 2021
- Front wing simplification due regulation. Heavy investigation into turbulent flow.
  - Turbulent flow is reduced so that cars are more likely to overtake - 'Dirty air' used to great advantage by Mercedes but loses interest in the sport.
  - DRS may be modified but not in scope of Van den Berg's research.
- Front wing Stagnation effects due regulation, not limited to simplification.
- Adjusting the Front Wing heights for better ground effect and competition, turbulent flow will be dissipated due to a obstacle between high pressure and low pressure areas.
- Wheel profile adjustments so that the ratio of factors that determine the suspension system are rekeyed directly - and is less reliant on the effects of profile deformation performable by the wheel and obstacle.
- Aerodynamical principles exaggerated concerning tyre wake - profile heavily reduced + camber reduction.
- Reduced vortex generation for bluff bodies, as these bodies have a strong disperse effect.

## Re-introduction of the 2021 Ground effect
It is beyond confident, without a doubt that the FIA will re-introduce the ground effect system into Formula One to increase competitive factors (which may subsequently allow for the removal of the dynamic DRS system).

The ground effect was proven to be inconsistent if there existed irregularities in the track. Ground effect was always nullified due to the sudden change of the ground plate when suspension is active.

**This created a potential danger to drivers when irregularities existed near bends** because due the nullification of the ground effect - a large amount of critical downforce will be subsequently lost which is crucial and paramount for the driver when controlling steering factors at bends - the driver may go offtrack as a result.

2021 poses a different approach to the ground effect by creating vanes that secure the airflow and Venturi effect to the bottom of the vehicle - exclusive to the effects of the suspension system. These vanes are directly connected to the suspension vane and do not oscillate with the vehicle when track irregularities occur.

### Disambiguation

In aviation, 'ground effect' occurs when the aircraft wings are close to a fixed surface - generating increased lift and reduced aerodynamic drag.

This is because when the wing is closer to the ground, vortices are interrupted by the ground and therefore reduce in size through dissipation. Downwash is reduced.

**Downwash** is a additional effect on lift for wings in aviation - the pressure differences caused by the "contour of the wing" as mentioned before will produce vortices.

The downstream component of the force is called **induced drag** because it has been "induced" by the action of the tip vortices.

It is important to note that lift is generally perpendicular to the direction of the relative flow of wind because as downwash 'induces' the relative flow downwards, the angle of which lift is affected. For a inverted wing, having the wing as low as possible will induce such effect and produce a downforce component in the direction of the Z plane.

Therefore: **A lower induced drag and lower downwash will create a greater lift vector.** Due to the angle of downstream component.

Van Den Berg's thesis heavily explores the interaction between the ground effect phenomenon and different wing heights and is worthy to read for additional knowledge.
>Generally, induced drag is greater at altitudes - as induced drag is reduced at lower altitudes.

## Interaction of the Ground Effect iss. 2005.

This section is in context of the 2005 F1 Regulation, an application & evaluation of the ground effect system.

The issue with the ground effect in 2005 (where redacted) was due to the irregular amount of downforce being presented at different part of track sessions - Say for an exaggerated example that a city circuit such as Baku had uneven road surfaces, there would be a conclusion that irregular, unexpected downforces were experienced at different stages of the track.

This became a large issue during uneven road surfaces at sharp turns - as a sudden loss of downforce (therefore a reduced grip on the ground) would often put cars into a spiral. This resulted in a lot of safety issues as several injuries occurred over a timespan of a few months. The FIA was left no choice but to immediately ban the use of ground effect.

For 2021 regulations the approach is to introduce a object attached directly to the suspension system to maintain as much as the airflow during track irregularities - therefore such characteristics associated with downforce were kept under control :

### Turning vanes

Characterised as thin, angular and long objects running along the outside of the floor of the vehicle.

These turning vanes attempt to eliminate or reduce the leakage that was originally caused in the 2005 ground effect model, as well as yield positive effects on the efficiency of the ground effect as a multiplier.

Additionally external influence would be reduced due to the availability and coverage of the turning vanes.

## Structural Implications

There were structural implications of the turning vanes, in order to maintain the aerodynamical efficiency of the turning vane as well as reduce weight - these vanes were created as very thin objects.

The attachment of the turning vane into the undercarriage prohibit any intrusions made into the undercarriage as deemed by technical regulations (for unknown purposes). This meant that the vanes must be a extrusion of the undercarriage-suspension system or glued onto the underbody of the car

To maintain integrity from the base of the turning vane (where attachment occurs), it is recommended during manufacturing to include a chamfer immediate to both planes. Manufacturing should also consider to create consistent break points where the production of the vane is vertical as to horizontal.

  Although such production scheme would take much longer to follow - the end result is that the vane would snap off smaller sections instead of larger sections - this meant that in a result of a consequence, the aftermath and effects would be reduced as much as possible to avoid an aerodynamical imbalance.

Turning vanes were exclusive
