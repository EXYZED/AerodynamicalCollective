Context:


Explanation of different wing heights for the dual airfoils - interactions between the wheels.
Parameters explored:
- Ground effect
- Separation and Stagnation points.
- Oil flow analysis

D. Jacques contributions:
- Difference between PIV [Where results are taken from numerous methods] SRANS (Steady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) &  DES (Detached Eddy Simulation). DNS and RANS have been excluded from the simulation as the object is dynamic in nature.

## Application into F1 Aerodynamics 2021
- Front wing simplification due regulation. Heavy investigation into turbulent flow.
  - Turbulent flow is reduced so that cars are more likely to overtake - 'Dirty air' used to great advantage by Mercedes but loses interest in the sport.
  - DRS may be modified but not in scope of Van den Berg's research.
- Front wing Stagnation effects due regulation, not limited to simplification.
- Adjusting the Front Wing heights for better ground effect and competition, turbulent flow will be dissipated due to a obstacle between high pressure and low pressure areas.
- Wheel profile adjustments so that the ratio of factors that determine the suspension system are rekeyed directly - and is less reliant on the effects of profile deformation performable by the wheel and obstacle.
- Aerodynamical principles exaggerated concerning tyre wake - profile heavily reduced + camber reduction.
- Reduced vortex generation for bluff bodies, as these bodies have a strong disperse effect.
